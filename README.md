This is a small project experimenting with the [Material UI Framework] (https://material-ui.com/) components using React. 

The live version can be accessed [here] (https://hschafer2017.github.io/ReactComponentExperimentsMaterialUI/).

To create your own React app, have a look at the [React Setup Docs] (https://www.github.com/hschafer2017/ReactComponentExperimentsMaterialUI/AutoinstalledReactSetupDocs.md) that come pre-installed when you create a React app.
